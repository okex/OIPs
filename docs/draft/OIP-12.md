## Our proposal

As a technical team ,we hope to provide technical support for OKChain. Here're what we're planning to do:

### 1,The comprehensive/real-time/multi-dementional OKChain data statistics provider with diverse charts and OPEN-API.

Different from the ordinary blockchain explorer, our explorer is more biased towards data analysis and statistics. It will display a wide variety of graphs, allowing 
users to more intuitive and clear understanding of the on-chain data. This explorer will include but not limited to the following modules:Dashboard、Bp list、BP details、Accounts 、Open API、Governance and so on, so as to provide a comprehensive/real-time/multi-dementional OKChain data statistics service.

### 2, The telegram/email alerting bot.

With this robot, you can get a notification on telegram or your email when these things happened:

a, when there is a newly registered/unregistered validator and when score of validator decreased.
b, when a new proposal's been issued/passed/rejected/excuted. it will track the whole process of a proposal.
c, when a large transaction occurs. 
d, when breaking news occurs.

That's all for the brief introduction. we sincerely hope to continue cooperating more deeply with OKChain.
