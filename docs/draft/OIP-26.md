## Our proposal

Operating a reliable validator node on any major blockchain is a large challenge. From our experience in the EOSIO ecosystem, we have developed a set of tools and workflows to monitor and maintain high-uptime infrastructure. Our goal with this OIP was to apply our expertise towards the OKChain ecosystem to improve the lives of Validator node operators.

## Live Proof of Concept
This Dashboard is connected to our Boidanimus validator node which is operating on the OKChain testnet.

## Next steps
As we continue this project we plan to implement
* on-chain performance monitoring using the full-node history solution
* Notifications, receive an email,text,chat message based on the performance stats of your validator node.
